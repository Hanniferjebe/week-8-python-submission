# Week 8 Project

This project is a data analysis report built using Python to track the global trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. It covers the spread of the virus, death tolls, vaccination progress, and comparisons across countries using real-world data.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- Compare key metrics across selected countries.
- Visualize trends using charts and maps.
- Communicate findings through code and narrative in a Jupyter Notebook.

- Python 3.x
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## ▶️ How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-data-tracker.git

2. Open the notebook:

   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   jupyter notebook Week 8 Project.ipynb

3. Run all cells to execute the analysis.

Note: Make sure owid-covid-data.csv is in the same folder as the notebook.

📈 Key Insights
Countries like the US and India reported the highest total cases.

Vaccination rollouts accelerated mid-2021 in several countries.

The death rate (% of total cases) varied notably by region.

Line and bar charts helped visualize both short-term spikes and long-term trends.

Pie charts were used to compare vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.

📌 Reflections
This project improved my skills in:

Working with time series data.

Cleaning and managing real-world datasets.

Creating meaningful visualizations to support data-driven insights.
